package For_loop;

//A detector compares the size of parts produced by a machine with the reference standard.
//        If the size of the part is larger, it can be sent to be fixed, and the detector prints the number 1.
//        If the size of the part is smaller, it is removed as reject, and the detector prints the number -1.
//        If the part was made perfect, it is sent to the box with ready products, and the detector prints 0.
//        Write a program, which takes the number of parts n as input, and then the sequence of detector prints.
//        The program should output numbers in a single line â€“ the number of ready parts,
//        the number of parts to be fixed, and the number of rejects.
//        Sample Input:
//        10
//        -1
//        0
//        1
//        0
//        0
//        1
//        1
//        -1
//        1
//        0
//        Sample Output:
//        4 4 2
