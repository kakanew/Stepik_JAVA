//Write a program that prints a part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 ...,
//        in which each number is repeated as many times as its value.
//        The input is a positive integer n â€“ the number of the elements of the sequence
//        that the program should print. The output should be written in a single line,
//        with all numbers separated by single spaces.
//        Sample Input:
//        7
//        Sample Output:
//        1 2 2 3 3 3 4
